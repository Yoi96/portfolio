				Design a user’s guide centered around the annual, global ATypI (Association Typographique International) typographic conference, where international professionals present research and provide workshops on the most influential happenings in the world of typography. The last in-person ATypI conference was in 2019, which is the schedule we will be using. They will resume in-person conferences later this year when they host ATypI Paris 2023. ATypI history: ATypI (atypi.org) was founded in 1957 by Charles Peignot (from the French type foundry Deberny & Peignot). The members of the organization come from the typographic community from all over the world and consist primarily of type designers, representatives of type foundries, graphic designers and typographers. Their mission is to promote, protect, and preserve the culture, history, and tradition of type—addressing both classic and contemporary concerns (from awarding prestigious accomplishments in type design, to campaigning for the protection of legally-sound typographic usage). Every four or five years the ATypI awards the Prix Charles Peignot for Excellence in Type Design to a designer under the age of 35 who has made groundbreaking strides within their arena of type design. The 2013 winner was Alexandra Korolkova. She studied at the Moscow State University of Printing Arts, is the author of Living Typography, and designed FF Carina for FontShop (formerly FontFont).

				<span class="kanagawa_title">THE GREAT WAVE OFF KANAGAWA</span>
				<p>
					In the background is Mount Fuji and its snow-capped summit, Mount Fuji is
the central figure of the Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji series, which depicts
the mountain from different angles.
The sea dominates the composition, which is based on the shape of a
wave that spreads out and dominates the entire scene before falling. At
this point, the wave forms a perfect spiral with its centre passing through
the centre of the design, allowing viewers to see Mount Fuji in the
background. The image is made up of curves, with the water's surface
being an extension of the curves inside the waves. The big wave's foamcurves generate other curves, which are divided into many small waves
that repeat the image of the large wave. Edmond de Goncourt, a French
writer, described the wave as follows: "[Drawing] board that was supposed
to have been called The Wave. It is much like that almost deified drawing,
[created] by a painter gripped by religious terror of a formidable sea that
surrounded his country: a drawing that shows [the wave's] angry ascent to
the sky, the deep azure of the curl's transparent interior, the tearing of its
crest that scatters in a shower of droplets in the form of an animal's claws.”

		<span class="product_detail_bold">Design Idea:</span> When reflecting on Japan's essence, Mount Fuji and Ukiyo-e (woodblock prints) immediately come to mind. Mount Fuji, an active stratovolcano on Honshu, Japan's largest island, stands as the nation's loftiest peak, the secondhighest island volcano in Asia (after Mount Kerinci on Sumatra), and the seventh-highest island peak worldwide. Positioned approximately 100 km (62 mi) southwest of Tokyo, Mount Fuji graces clear days with its awe-inspiring presence, embodying Japan's cultural heritage with its snow-capped symmetrical cone that endures for much of the year. This iconic landmark is a centerpiece in art, and photography, and draws tourists, hikers, and climbers alike. Among the esteemed masterpieces of Ukiyo-e, "The Great Wave off Kanagawa" stands out, depicting three boats navigating turbulent waters, with a towering wave spiraling at the center and Mount Fuji etched in the background. However, in my design, I choose to preserve the captivating allure of the great wave, as it encapsulates Japan's maritime essence and artistic legacy. Regarding size, I envision this design as a pocketbook, ensuring ease of carry for attendees strolling through the Atypi event. For the title page design, I drew inspiration from the professor's suggestion. Each title is set against a background resembling rolling waves, symbolizing the dynamic spirit of Japan.
