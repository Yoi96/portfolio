		The background of this photo features the Westfield World Trade Center, a prominent shopping mall and transit hub located in the Financial District of Manhattan, New York City. My friend and I decided to visit this mall on a sunny afternoon to explore its many shops and attractions. Before we walked into the mall, we bought a cup of coffee from Starbucks.
		<br><br>

		We ordered iced chocolate coffee, a refreshing and indulgent treat that was perfect for the warm weather. The barista crafted our drinks with care, adding the right amount of chocolate syrup and ice, making them both visually appealing and delicious. As we sipped our drinks, we decided to take a photo to capture the moment. The Westfield World Trade Center, with its sleek, modern design, provided a stunning backdrop for our picture. The combination of the coffee and the striking architecture made for a perfect shot.<br><br>

		When I looked at the photo later, I felt inspired to turn it into a poster. I thought it would be a great way to commemorate our day out and the unique aesthetic of the location. However, I noticed that my friend's hand was in the frame, which slightly distracted from the overall composition. To enhance the visual appeal, I decided to use Photoshop to remove my friend's hand from the photo. This task required some careful editing to ensure the background looked seamless.<br><br>

		Additionally, I wanted to emphasize the refreshing nature of the iced chocolate coffee, so I added more ice cubes to the drink in Photoshop. This small adjustment made the coffee look even more enticing and highlighted its cool, refreshing quality. The final result was a visually striking image that perfectly captured the essence of our visit to the Westfield World Trade Center and our enjoyment of the iced chocolate coffee from Starbucks. Creating this poster was a fun and creative way to remember a wonderful day spent with my friend at one of New York City's most iconic locations.
