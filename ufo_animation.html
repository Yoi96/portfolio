In this project, I created a captivating GIF animation featuring a UFO, designed using Blender. The animation starts with the letters "U", "F", and "O" positioned on the ground, setting the stage for the UFO's dramatic entrance. Each letter is crafted to match the futuristic and mysterious theme of the UFO.
<p>
As the animation progresses, the UFO smoothly flies into the scene from above, its design sleek and otherworldly. The UFO hovers over the letters, emitting a glowing beam of light that gradually pulls each letter upwards. The letters "U", "F", and "O" are lifted into the UFO one by one, creating a visually dynamic and engaging sequence.
</p><p>
The use of Blender allowed me to experiment with various techniques, including keyframe animation, realistic texturing, and lighting effects. These techniques were essential in achieving the lifelike movement of the UFO and the letters, as well as in creating the glowing beam effect. The background is kept simple to keep the focus on the UFO and the letters, ensuring the animation remains clear and impactful.
</p><p>
This project, completed as part of HUW 162: 3D Animation, demonstrates my ability to apply classroom knowledge to create an imaginative and technically proficient animation. The final GIF effectively showcases the potential of 3D modeling and animation in bringing creative concepts to life.
