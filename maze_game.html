        This is a maze game that tells the story of a 10-year-old girl who failed to commit suicide and became a persistent vegetative state. In the game, we can see what happened to the girl initially, and when the player wins, they can also see the girl's story. The first level describes how the girl, after failing to commit suicide, became a vegetative state, as we learn from the doctors' conversations. The player controls the girl to leave the maze. During this, we encounter a person dressed in a rabbit costume who tells the player that his key is missing and asks for help to find it. After finding the key outside a pink house, the player enters and plays the maze game.
        
        <p>
            The second level describes the girl searching for keys and coins in a grassy maze to clear the level. The third level describes the girl waking up in a hospital room and then walking downstairs to a dark maze, where one of the rooms contains a black coffin, symbolizing that the girl has died. At the end of the game, from the doctors' conversation, we learn that the girl couldn't be saved.

            <span class="text_bold"># Health Bar</span><br>
            In this game, there are no health-boosting items available. Instead, if the player triggers a trap or encounters an object that diminishes their health, it will reduce their health bar by either 20% or 100%, depending on the severity of the trap or object.

            <p>

            If the player's health bar reaches 0%, they will face the consequence of death and be returned to the main menu page. This mechanic adds an element of challenge and urgency to the gameplay, requiring players to navigate the environment cautiously and avoid potential hazards.</p>

            <span class="text_bold"># Coins</span><br>
            In this game, players must find coins to either unlock doors or advance to the next level. To progress, they need to search the environment for these coins diligently.
            <p>
            As players gather coins, they move closer to unlocking doors blocking their path or accessing new levels, driving them to continue their search and exploration..</p>

            <span class="text_bold"># Key</span> <br>
            In the game, players must find the Bunny's Key to unlock the door and progress. This key is hidden within the environment, requiring careful exploration and problem-solving to locate. Once found, it grants access to the next stage. Failure to find the key impedes progress, motivating players to explore thoroughly. This mechanic encourages engagement with the game world and rewards players with advancement when they successfully uncover the key's location.

            <span class="text_bold"># Trap</span> <br>
            When the player steps on this trap, their health is reduced by 20% each time. This significant health deduction adds a challenging element, requiring players to navigate carefully and avoid traps to maintain their health. Since there are no items to restore health, players must be vigilant and strategic to survive and progress in the game. If health reaches 0%, the player will die and return to the main menu, emphasizing the importance of avoiding traps.
